# README

This code implements a number of computer vision techniques, including:

* Lucas-Kanade optical flow
* Image alignment and warping
* Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids
* Image blending

To run the code, you will need to have Python and OpenCV installed.
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the code by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
This will run the code and display the results.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following files:

* `ex3_utils.py`: This file contains utility functions for image processing.
* `main.py`: This file contains the main function, which runs the code.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV 4.0 or higher

The README file has been updated to include information about the new code that you provided. Specifically, the following changes have been made:

* The new code for optical flow using Lucas-Kanade and correlation has been added.
* The new demo for image alignment using translation has been added.
* The README file has been updated to reflect the changes to the code.

I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
